# Zed0ckPyhonParty

In this project I'm learning Python through making some code. Every code file 
is a lesson and I try to learn something new.

At first I'll remember some basic stuff. Later I'll go through some input validation 
tasks and web scrabing for example. Maybe I also focus working with CSV and JSON 
files as well.
