# Zed0ckPyhonParty

In this personel project where I'm learning Python through making some code. Every code 
file is a lesson and I try to learn something new.

I also use github project to track my issues. I use this beacause I want to learn how 
github project works and I'm new with it. 

At first I'll remember some basic stuff in first lessons. Later I'll go through some 
input validation tasks and web scrabing for example. Maybe I also focus working with 
CSV and JSON files as well.
